# Efficient-Latent-Space-Modeling-for-Image-Synthesis

This project implements a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for learning efficient latent representations of images and generating new samples.

## Features

• Constructs an encoder-decoder network to map images to a low-dimensional latent space.

• Applies the reparameterization trick for stable training and efficient sampling.

• Optimized with KL divergence and reconstruction loss to balance latent space structure and image quality.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
   
2. Train the model: python train.py
   
3. Generate images: python generate.py

## Future Improvements

• Enhance latent space interpretability.

• Experiment with different loss functions and architectures.

• Improve training stability for higher-resolution images.
